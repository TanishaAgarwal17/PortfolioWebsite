                <p>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. 
                    Today, designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website's overall 
                    functionality. Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.

                    interact with when using a website, app, or electronic device. UX refers to the entire 
                    interaction you have with a product, including how you feel about the interaction.
